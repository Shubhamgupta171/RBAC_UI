# RBAC UI (Role-Based Access Control)

This is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI built with **React.js**. It allows users to manage users, roles, and permissions in a secure and efficient manner. The UI is designed with responsiveness in mind and features a clean, modern look. The project uses **React.js** for the frontend, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **React Router** for routing. Users can log in, register, and interact with the system through modals and navigable pages. A fixed **navbar** provides easy access to different sections like `Home`, `Users`, `Roles`, and `Permissions`. If the user is not logged in, a modal is shown to prompt the login/register process. The homepage features a full-screen background image with a fixed position that stays in place during scrolling. The project is fully responsive, and Tailwind CSS utility classes are used to create the layout and UI elements. The user session is managed through **localStorage**, which stores user data for persistent login states. Users can log out, which removes their data from **localStorage**. To run the project locally, clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the development server. This project provides a foundational RBAC UI that can be extended with more complex role and permission management features. Future enhancements include adding backend authentication, advanced role and permission management, an admin panel for controlling the RBAC system, and improved error handling. This UI system can be integrated into larger enterprise applications where secure user access and permission management are necessary. Contributions are welcome, and developers can fork the repository and submit pull requests. The project is licensed under the MIT License.
